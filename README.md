# Field Warming Setup for Plant Heat Stress
Climate change will dramatically impact the physiology of plants, in both ecological and agricultural contexts. Conducting experiments to elucidate plant responses to heat stress are essential to prepare for and understand the impact of coming climatic changes. Ideal experiments are those wherein plants are exposed to higher temperatures while maintaining as close to natural conditions as possible. Field warming setups are the best experimental analog to future climate change temperatures. In this project, heating cables were combined with Open Top Containers to create a field warming setup that can be used to explore plant response to heat stress.

## Main features
In this project, a field warming setup was constructed consisting of an Open Top Container (basically a clear box with no top) with added heating from heating cables. The purpose of this setup was to investigate how plants, especially snowdrops and Arabidopsis, react to increased temperatures. The field warming setup is different from an indoor growth chamber because it is outside where the plants can be exposed to normal environmental processes.
